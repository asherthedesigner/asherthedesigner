- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Asher! Iâ€™m a Designer and CMS Developer dedicated to crafting brands and websites that make a lasting impact.
- ðŸŽ¨ As a Designer, I specialize in branding, UI/UX, and marketing materials using tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma.
Iâ€™m the craftsman behind brand stories that captivate, creating visuals that resonate on a deeper level. My approach to premium branding ensures every color, every shape, and every element contributes to an identity thatâ€™s not only seen but felt. For me, building a brandâ€™s identity goes beyond designâ€”itâ€™s about weaving a businessâ€™s essence into a narrative that leaves a mark.
- ðŸ’» On the development side, Iâ€™m skilled in WordPress, Shopify, Squarespace, and Wix. I build dynamic, user-friendly websites tailored to meet your business goals.
From sleek, high-converting eCommerce stores to fully customized sites with advanced features, I deliver solutions that are visually stunning and optimized for performance, SEO, and scalability.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me?
You can shoot me an email at asherthedesigner@gmail.com. Iâ€™m always open to discussing projects, collaborations, or just chatting about all things design and development!
- âš¡ Fun fact:
When Iâ€™m not crafting brands or building websites, Iâ€™m probably exploring new coffee spots or sketching up random ideasâ€”sometimes both at the same time!
